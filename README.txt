Installation
------------

Just get the code and make temporary folder writable by web server. For example:

 git clone git://gitorious.org/odt-html5/odt-html5-py.git
 cd odt-html5-py

Start by:
 python index.py

Or script which makes it run even if it fails:
 ./runner.sh

After successfull setup just upload test.odt to same folder and see the result.
Default port is 8042, so try for example: http://localhost:8042
